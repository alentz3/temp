# Image Location Toolkit Project

## Summary

In a world where technology gives us the ability to take pictures and share them at a staggering rate, keeping track of where they were taken is not always a simple task. Fortunately, not only do image formats have the ability to store location metadata that can be leveraged for this, but there are several publicly available APIs (application program interfaces) that can provide enrichment of location data. In addition, OCR (optical character recognition) frameworks can be leveraged for extracting text from these pictures to obtain additional clues from these APIs. Finally, providing a mechanism to group photos will allow an enriched photo in the group the ability to provide clues for the other photos. Using a combination of these techniques, it should be possible to make a general prediction about the location where a particular picture was taken.

## Opportunities For Extension

The initial implementation of this toolkit can focus exclusively on the ability to attempt extraction of location metadata from an image along with developing a RESTful web service and GUI. After the development of these capabilities, the ability to extract text using an OCR framework can be added, followed by enrichment through public APIs. Additional capabilities such as grouping can be added as these capabilities and algorithms are perfected.
